# Election Analysis with Python

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from a election, using a python script to determine the winner, as well as votes per candidate, votes per county, and total votes. The election data is presented in a csv file, and the results are printed in a txt file. Input file can be found on [election-results.csv](Resources/election_results.csv), the output on [election.txt](analysis/election_results.txt), and the script on [PyPoll_Challenge.py](PyPoll_Challenge.py).

## Election-Audit Results
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
