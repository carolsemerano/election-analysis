# Election Analysis with Python

## Overview of Election Audit

The election data is presented in a csv file, and the results are printed in a txt file. Input file can be found on [election-results.csv](Resources/election_results.csv), the output on [election-results.txt](analysis/election_results.txt), and the script on [PyPoll_Challenge.py](PyPoll_Challenge.py).

## Election-Audit Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
